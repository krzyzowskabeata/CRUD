# CRUD

Would you like to view the project?
With the use of Node Modules, set up json server by $ json-server --watch db.json --port 3500 and run $ npm install and $ npm start commands (all from the main folder).

When it comes to log in the app, use bdylan account (his password is 1234).
Hope you enjoy!
